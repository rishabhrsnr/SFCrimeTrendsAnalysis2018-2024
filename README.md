To investigate daily crime patterns and identify peak hours for heightened vigilance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of San Francisco Police Department in case resolution across different districts.
To deliver predictive models for crime rates and propose strategic approaches to crime reduction.

**Methodology**

Applied time series analysis including ARIMA and exponential smoothing to project crime rates.
Conducted EDA to discern daily crime trends, with a focus on larceny-theft occurrences.
Assessed the performance of the San Francisco Police Department through incident resolution metrics across districts.
